As a consultant somehow I'm always finding myself entering situations where there's a lot of wasted effort and increased project complexity due to social dynamics much more than any pure technical challenge. We have Heads Of with the majority of their time in meetings, programmers expected to be 'full stack', security who don't dev like the project teams, vendors and SaaS many of which were bought to help solve a problem and never progressed much further from the initial buy, architects who have never sat with a person who's implementing their design. We have secret chats, we have mundane public chats, all over three chat applications and four video chat options. We have email and Trello and Jira and Github Issues and a Google Drive and Confluence. And overall we have so much work that we're always busy. Busy busy busy.

Why so busy? If you want to landscape your yard, say you want to plant a couple of trees and build a garden bed, are you going to spend a couple of days just swinging shovels and running between the hose and the garden?  I don't think so. I kthink you'll get out there in the morning, look around, maybe think aboout it in your down time for a few weeks beforehand. Then you might write some lists and draw some pictures, gather what you need and then get into it. You go for a bit, 



Most companies within the capitalist construct build from competition as a foundational theory. This culture is often absorbed into the workplace, creating division between business functions and teams. 
Not only are some people trying to compete against other staff members, 
a feeling of distrust breeds due to the feeling of surveillance of looking... wanting to survive


Sunken cost fallacy
