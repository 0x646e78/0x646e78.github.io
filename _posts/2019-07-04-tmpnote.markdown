Added this to my *.bash_alias* to pop into a scratch space in vim.

{% highlight bash %}
{% raw %}
alias tmpnote="vim -c 'startinsert' $(mktemp)"
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


so now I can just `tmpnote` and then _q!_ once I'm done.

It's been handy for random note taking when I don't want to cloud sync anything or bust open a gui.
