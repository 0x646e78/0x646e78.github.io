I recently added the following alisa to my *.bash_aliases* file. Now if I want a temporary file to jot down some notes or dump some text, I just run `tmpnote` and then *:q!* once I'm done.

{% highlight bash %}
{% raw %}
alias tmpnote="vim -c 'startinsert' $(mktemp)"
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

It's been handy for random note taking when I don't want to cloud sync anything or bust open a gui.
