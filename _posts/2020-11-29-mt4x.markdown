I've recently serviced a couple of these four track cassette recorders.
Here I overview the process that I took and try to share info that I couldn't easily find online myself.

The images used are mostly from the restoration of a 100V machine I picked up on eBay. When I got it
 it was dead and extremely dirty inside and out. I have added images from another machine in some places
 to show differences or where I missed photographing something originally.
