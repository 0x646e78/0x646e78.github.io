I've recently serviced a couple of these four track cassette recorders.
Here I overview the process that I took and try to share info that I couldn't easily find online myself.

The images used are mostly from the restoration of a 100V machine I picked up on eBay. When I got it
 it was dead and extremely dirty inside and out. I have added images from another machine in some places
 to show differences or where I missed photographing something originally.

*Starting Point: Dead & Dirty MT4X*

Before you start unscrewing anything, you'll want to make sure you've got a few things ready. I make sure I've got a clean work area and the following available.

 - 2x Phillips Screwdrivers. A little one, and a bigger one.
 - Tweezers. I prefer to have both a bent and straight set on hand, but one will do.
 - Needle Nose Pliers.
 - A marker or two.
 - Plastic pry Tool. I have a cheap phone openining tool, but a public transport card usually works too.
 - Cotton/Q Tips. Best to have quite a few on hand.
 - Vernier Calipers are an optional which can help with measuring belts if you don't know exactly what you need or have.
 - A toothbrush and/or stiff brush for cleaning plastic parts.
 - Electronic cleaning & lubricating solutions. I use:
 - - a solvent spray for jacks.
 - - 'clean & lubricant' with a spray nozzle adapter for pots & switches.
 - - oil for motors & mechanical parts. Often I'll use a sewing machine or motor oil but here am trying out inox mx3.
 - - Isopropyl.
 - Something to keep screws organised. Small plastic pots, jar lids etc are good options.
 - A toothpick or similar for applying oil.
 - A cassette tape for testing. A Chrome Type-II type is recommended.
 - A clear space to work. I like to utilise my standing desk and lay down a sheet of card - if someone wants to buy me an anti static mat, both xmas and my birthday are near at the time of writing this ;)
 - Time & patience. This stuff can get fiddly and frustrating, you want enough time to not rush things, and to be able to leave the unit disassembled and come back to it if you hit a snag.

*Keeping fixings tidy saves a headache later on*

Now that we have a space to work and appropriate tools for the job, let's get into the fun and pull this thing apart.

The first thing you want to do, which I've neglected to photograph, is remove all of the knobs. All knobs, and all mixer sliders will pull off. Some might be a bit sticky but just pull straight up and it will come off. Don't try to remove the push buttons, they're affixed from teh inside.

Once the knobs are removed, flip the unit over. Be careful of the exposed knobs, you don't want to break these (or scratch your desk). I find as long as you lay it down gently you'll be fine.

There are 10 screws to remove here. 7 long, 3 short. 

Once those are out, flip it over with the rear facing you. Gently lift the top from the rear. You will find here a ground wire connected to the cassette mechanism. This needs to be removed before lifting the top further. Take the screw out and set it aside. A really nice thing about the mtx units is that the screws are generally all the same, so you can just keep all of these gold screws together.

Although usually it is obvious where grounding wires connect when putting the mt4x back together, this is where I tend to use a marker. I will usually draw a coloured line across the grounding connection before removal so that it is easy to find the connection point later.

*Remove the mechanism grounding wire before opening fully*

With that wire out of the way we can proceed to open the unit. Carefully pivit from the rear to open. There is another ground - this time a pin connector - that you'll find starting to pull. Slip this off before opening further. You can choose to fully open the unit if you have space, or like me lean the top back against something. Always be careful not to pinch wires or apply too much pressure to connection points.

*Marking grounding points can prevent later confusion*

With the unit open, lift the shielding layer from the PCB (no need to fully disconnect it), and remove the connections between the top and base. For the grey and blue ribbon connectors there is a black terminal block that can be pulled up to release. The white and red connectors can be pulled straight up. If something feels very stuck, double check what you're doing before proceeding.

*Disconnect the connection points between top from base*

With the unit top and base seperated, set the top aside somewhere safe, and we will work through servicing the base parts. First take some time to familiarise yourself with what you've got in front of you and look for any damage, fluff, signs of past water spills etc. Then before continuing, fit the shield back over the PCB. Have you spotted the fuse yet? It is not the most convenient place, hidden away under the cassette mechanism.
