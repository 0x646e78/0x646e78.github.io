I've recently serviced a couple of these four track cassette recorders.
Here I overview the process that I took and try to share info that I couldn't easily find online myself.

The images used are mostly from the restoration of a 100V machine I picked up on eBay. When I got it
 it was dead and extremely dirty inside and out. I have added images from another machine in some places
 to show differences or where I missed photographing something originally.

*Starting Point: Dead & Dirty MT4X*

Before you start unscrewing anything, you'll want to make sure you've got a few things ready. I make sure I have the following available.

 - 2x Phillips Screwdrivers. A little one, and a bigger one.
 - Tweezers. I prefer to have both a bent and straight set on hand, but one will do.
 - Needle Nose Pliers.
 - A marker or two.
 - Plastic pry Tool. I have a cheap phone openining tool, but a public transport card usually works too.
 - Cotton/Q Tips. Best to have quite a few on hand.
 - Vernier Calipers are an optional which can help with measuring belts if you don't know exactly what you need or have.
 - A toothbrush and/or stiff brush for cleaning plastic parts.
 - Electronic cleaning & lubricating solutions. I use:
 - - a solvent spray for jacks.
 - - 'clean & lubricant' with a spray nozzle adapter for pots & switches.
 - - oil for motors & mechanical parts. Often I'll use a sewing machine or motor oil but here am trying out inox mx3.
 - - Isopropyl.
 - Something to keep screws organised. Small plastic pots, jar lids etc are good options.
 - A toothpick or similar for applying oil.
 - A cassette tape for testing. A Chrome Type-II type is recommended.
 - A clear space to work. I like to utilise my standing desk and lay down a sheet of card - if someone wants to buy me an anti static mat, both xmas and my birthday are near at the time of writing this ;)
 - Time & patience. This stuff can get fiddly and frustrating, you want enough time to not rush things, and to be able to leave the unit disassembled and come back to it if you hit a snag.

*Keeping fixings tidy saves a headache later on*

I also want to note the values of fuses, servo and belts which are from my observations and measurements. I have been unable to find any values for these online and am yet to et hold of a service manual. I would greatly appreciate comments of official values, or your observed values if you are taking a unit apart.

- 1x 70mm x 1mm square belt
- 1x 115mm x 4.7mm flat belt
- 1x Sankyo SHU2L 12v motor
- 1x 240v 500mA 20mm fast blow fuse (100v model) 
- 1x 240v 120mA 20mm fast blow fuse (240v model)

Now that we have a space to work and appropriate tools for the job, let's get into the fun and pull this thing apart.

The first thing you want to do, which I've neglected to photograph, is remove all of the knobs. All knobs, and all mixer sliders will pull off. Some might be a bit sticky but just pull straight up and it will come off. Don't try to remove the push buttons, they're affixed from the inside.

Once the knobs are removed, flip the unit over. Be careful of the exposed knobs, you don't want to break these (or scratch your desk). I find as long as you lay it down gently you'll be fine.

There are 10 screws to remove here. 7 long, 3 short. 

Once those are out, flip it over with the rear facing you. Gently lift the top from the rear. You will find here a ground wire connected to the cassette mechanism. This needs to be removed before lifting the top further. Take the screw out and set it aside. A really nice thing about the mtx units is that the screws are generally all the same, so you can just keep all of these gold screws together.

Although usually it is obvious where grounding wires connect when putting the mt4x back together, this is where I tend to use a marker. I will usually draw a coloured line across the grounding connection before removal so that it is easy to find the connection point later.

*Remove the mechanism grounding wire before opening fully*

With that wire out of the way we can proceed to open the unit. Carefully pivit from the rear to open. There is another ground - this time a pin connector - that you'll find starting to pull. Slip this off before opening further. You can choose to fully open the unit if you have space, or like me lean the top back against something. Always be careful not to pinch wires or apply too much pressure to connection points.

*Marking grounding points can prevent later confusion*

With the unit open, lift the shielding layer from the PCB (no need to fully disconnect it), and remove the connections between the top and base. For the grey and blue ribbon connectors there is a black terminal block that can be pulled up to release. The white and red connectors can be pulled straight up. If something feels very stuck, double check what you're doing before proceeding.

*Disconnect the connection points between top from base*

With the unit top and base seperated, set the top aside somewhere safe, and we will work through servicing the base parts. First take some time to familiarise yourself with what you've got in front of you and look for any damage, fluff, signs of past water spills etc. Then before continuing, fit the shield back over the PCB. Have you spotted the fuse yet? It is not the most convenient place, hidden away under the cassette mechanism.

*A view of the mt4x heads*

With a small brush and tweezers remove any dust and fluff from the cassette mechanism, taking care not to touch the heads at this stage. Once you've done this, remove the three remaining screws holding the mechanism in place.

*Remove the three corner screws from the cassette machanism*

You can the gently flip the mechanism over to the right, resting it upon the shielding.

From here we have access to the fuse. If it needs replacing, do so now.

Once again, clean out the exposed area, taking care of any electronic parts.

Now, there are four small screws holding the cassette mech cover in place. Remove these, carefully setting them aside and ensuring you don't lose the two plastic latche parts. With this removed you will be able to remove the belts. If they have deteriorated you may need to clean their path in the wheels with a little warm soapy water on a q-tip.

To oil the servo we need to remove it. There are three screws for this, and once it is out you'll want to pull the plastic belt wheel off. Give this a clean, and then oil the motor. To oil the motor use a toothpick or similar device rather than trying to apply direct from an oil dispenser. Give a couple of drops into the shaft and then gently rotate it a couple of times. Clean any residue from the exposed shaft before pushing the belt wheel back on, leaving a slight gap between it and the motor body.

Refix the motor, and then replace the belts (ideally with new ones). Refix the mech cover, being careful not to break the plastic parts.

*Leave a slight gap when refitting*

Refix the cassette machnism in place, and now we will clean the tape heads. Pour a little isopropyl alcohol into a canister, dipping a cotton swab and then using this to gently wide across the heads. If any dirt is visible on the swab tip, flip it over and use the other end until it is clean. I also clean the steel mechanical parts with iso, and the pinch rollers with a little warm, slightly soapy water.

Now just make sure you've cleaned out al the dust and fluff from the base before we start on the top section.

Coming soon.... cleaning the top section and putting it all back together.
